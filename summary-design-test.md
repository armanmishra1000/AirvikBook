# Design Testing Summary - User Registration & Login

## Overview
This document summarizes all the visual testing issues that were identified and fixed for the User Registration and User Login & Session Management features.

## Registration Page Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Layout Issues
**Issue**: "Already have an account? Sign in here" and "By signing up, you agree..." text were placed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved both text elements inside the RegistrationForm component, placing them below the "Create Account" button in the correct order.

### 2. Error Message Display Consistency
**Issue**: Browser-native validation messages were inconsistent with the form's error styling.
**Fix**: Added `noValidate` attribute to the form to disable browser validation and ensure all errors use the consistent red text format.

### 3. Password Tips Message Display Issue
**Issue**: Unwanted blue informational message box appeared below password requirements.
**Fix**: Removed the password tips message box entirely from the PasswordStrengthIndicator component.

### 4. Password Requirements Visibility Behavior Issue
**Issue**: Password requirements were visible by default even when user hadn't started typing, and remained visible even after all requirements were met.
**Fix**: Implemented conditional rendering logic to show requirements only when password field is focused or contains text, and automatically hide them when all password requirements are satisfied.

### 5. Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy Links 404 Error
**Issue**: Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy resulted in 404 errors.
**Fix**: Created new pages at `/terms` and `/privacy` routes with proper content and styling.

### 6. Create Account Button Text Alignment During Loading
**Issue**: Button text shifted left during loading state instead of remaining centered.
**Fix**: Updated CSS to use `justify-center` and removed negative margin from spinner for proper centering.

### 7. Password Visibility Toggle Icon Display Issue
**Issue**: Eye icon appeared cropped or cut off when toggling password visibility.
**Fix**: Updated button styling to use fixed width and proper centering to prevent icon cropping.

### 8. Terms Consent Checkbox Extra Border Issue
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when selected, creating double-border effect.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings.

### 9. Toast Notifications for Registration Messages
**Issue**: Inconsistent use of inline error messages and success states.
**Fix**: Implemented consistent toast notifications for all success and error messages, removing inline general error display.

### 10. Post-Registration Sensitive Data Logging Issue
**Issue**: User email and tokens were being logged to console after successful registration.
**Fix**: Removed console.log statement that exposed sensitive user information.

### 11. Google Sign-up Button Focus Border Issue
**Issue**: The "Sign up with Google" button displayed an unwanted focus border/ring when focused, creating visual inconsistency with the design system.
**Fix**: Removed the focus ring styling (`focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2`) from the GoogleOAuthRedirectButton component and replaced it with `focus:ring-0` to eliminate any focus indicators while maintaining accessibility.

### 12. Create Account Button Hover Transition Issue
**Issue**: The "Create Account" button displayed unwanted hover transition effects including shadow, transform, and animation when users hovered over it, creating visual inconsistency with the design system.
**Fix**: Removed all transition-related CSS classes including `transition-all`, `duration-normal`, `transform`, `hover:shadow-lg`, `hover:-translate-y-1`, and `active:translate-y-0` from the button, leaving only the essential hover color change (`hover:bg-airvik-purple`) for basic interactivity feedback.

## Login Page Issues Fixed

### 13. Duplicate "Don't have an account? Sign up for free" Text
**Issue**: Text appeared both inside the form and in the page footer, creating duplication.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate text from the footer, keeping only the version inside the LoginForm component.

### 14. "By signing in, you agree..." Text Positioned Incorrectly
**Issue**: Terms agreement text was displayed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved the text inside the LoginForm component, placing it below the sign-up link.

### 15. Extra Border Around "Remember me" Checkbox
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when checked or unchecked, creating visual inconsistency.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings, matching the registration form checkbox styling.

### 16. Broken Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Links
**Issue**: Links resulted in 404 errors (same as registration page).
**Fix**: Links now work correctly since the pages were created for the registration page fixes.

### 17. Login Form Validation Error Message Styling Inconsistency
**Issue**: General error messages used speech bubble styling with background, border, and padding, inconsistent with field errors. Input field text was also turning red during errors.
**Fix**: Replaced speech bubble styling with simple red text format (`text-caption text-error`), removed background, border, and padding, added `noValidate` to form for consistent validation handling, and ensured input field text remains black (`text-airvik-black dark:text-airvik-white`) while only borders and error messages are red.

### 18. Google Sign-in Button Focus Border Issue
**Issue**: The "Sign in with Google" button displayed an unwanted focus border/ring when focused, creating visual inconsistency with the design system.
**Fix**: Removed the focus ring styling from the GoogleOAuthRedirectButton component (same component as registration form) to eliminate any focus indicators while maintaining accessibility.

### 19. Sign In Button Hover Transition Issue
**Issue**: The "Sign In" button displayed unwanted hover transition effects including shadow, transform, and animation when users hovered over it, creating visual inconsistency with the design system.
**Fix**: Removed all transition-related CSS classes including `transition-all`, `duration-normal`, `transform`, `hover:shadow-lg`, `hover:-translate-y-1`, and `active:translate-y-0` from the button, leaving only the essential hover color change (`hover:bg-airvik-purple`) for basic interactivity feedback.

### 20. Error State Focus Border Consistency
**Issue**: Fields with validation errors were switching from red border to blue border when focused, creating inconsistent visual feedback. Additionally, there was a delay in border color changes due to CSS transitions, and hover border colors were conflicting with focus border colors.
**Fix**: Enhanced focus styling logic with `focus:ring-0`, explicit `focus:border-error`, `focus:transition-none`, and `focus:border-airvik-blue` to ensure error fields maintain red borders and red focus rings (`focus:ring-error`) when focused, while normal fields use blue borders and blue focus rings (`focus:border-airvik-blue focus:ring-airvik-blue`), eliminating any blue outline appearance, ensuring immediate border color changes without delay, and preventing hover border colors from interfering with focus states.

## Email Verification Page Issues Fixed

### 21. Broken "Contact support" link on Check Your Email page
**Issue**: The "Contact support" link on the Check Your Email page was pointing to `/contact` which resulted in a 404 error, preventing users from accessing help when experiencing email verification issues.
**Fix**: Created a comprehensive support page at `/contact` route with multiple contact methods (email and phone), categorized FAQ section with expandable questions, and additional help resources, providing users with multiple ways to get assistance for email verification and other issues.

### 22. Sensitive Data Logging on Check Your Email Page
**Issue**: The Check Your Email page was logging sensitive user information to the browser console, including user email addresses, verification tokens, and API response details. These logs were visible to anyone with access to the browser's developer tools, creating a significant privacy and security risk.
**Fix**: Removed all console.log statements that exposed sensitive user data, including URL parameters logging, decoded email logging, verification token logging, API response logging, and other debugging information that contained personally identifiable information. The page now functions properly without exposing any user data in the console.
