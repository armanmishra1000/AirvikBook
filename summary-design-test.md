# Design Testing Summary - User Registration & Login

## Overview
This document summarizes all the visual testing issues that were identified and fixed for the User Registration and User Login & Session Management features.

## Registration Page Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Layout Issues
**Issue**: "Already have an account? Sign in here" and "By signing up, you agree..." text were placed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved both text elements inside the RegistrationForm component, placing them below the "Create Account" button in the correct order.

### 2. Error Message Display Consistency
**Issue**: Browser-native validation messages were inconsistent with the form's error styling.
**Fix**: Added `noValidate` attribute to the form to disable browser validation and ensure all errors use the consistent red text format.

### 3. Password Tips Message Display Issue
**Issue**: Unwanted blue informational message box appeared below password requirements.
**Fix**: Removed the password tips message box entirely from the PasswordStrengthIndicator component.

### 4. Password Requirements Visibility Behavior Issue
**Issue**: Password requirements were visible by default even when user hadn't started typing, and remained visible even after all requirements were met.
**Fix**: Implemented conditional rendering logic to show requirements only when password field is focused or contains text, and automatically hide them when all password requirements are satisfied.

### 5. Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy Links 404 Error
**Issue**: Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy resulted in 404 errors.
**Fix**: Created new pages at `/terms` and `/privacy` routes with proper content and styling.

### 6. Create Account Button Text Alignment During Loading
**Issue**: Button text shifted left during loading state instead of remaining centered.
**Fix**: Updated CSS to use `justify-center` and removed negative margin from spinner for proper centering.

### 7. Password Visibility Toggle Icon Display Issue
**Issue**: Eye icon appeared cropped or cut off when toggling password visibility.
**Fix**: Updated button styling to use fixed width and proper centering to prevent icon cropping.

### 8. Terms Consent Checkbox Extra Border Issue
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when selected, creating double-border effect.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings.

### 9. Toast Notifications for Registration Messages
**Issue**: Inconsistent use of inline error messages and success states.
**Fix**: Implemented consistent toast notifications for all success and error messages, removing inline general error display.

### 10. Post-Registration Sensitive Data Logging Issue
**Issue**: User email and tokens were being logged to console after successful registration.
**Fix**: Removed console.log statement that exposed sensitive user information.

## Login Page Issues Fixed

### 11. Duplicate "Don't have an account? Sign up for free" Text
**Issue**: Text appeared both inside the form and in the page footer, creating duplication.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate text from the footer, keeping only the version inside the LoginForm component.

### 12. "By signing in, you agree..." Text Positioned Incorrectly
**Issue**: Terms agreement text was displayed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved the text inside the LoginForm component, placing it below the sign-up link.

### 13. Extra Border Around "Remember me" Checkbox
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when checked or unchecked, creating visual inconsistency.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings, matching the registration form checkbox styling.

### 14. Broken Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Links
**Issue**: Links resulted in 404 errors (same as registration page).
**Fix**: Links now work correctly since the pages were created for the registration page fixes.

### 15. Login Form Validation Error Message Styling Inconsistency
**Issue**: General error messages used speech bubble styling with background, border, and padding, inconsistent with field errors. Input field text was also turning red during errors.
**Fix**: Replaced speech bubble styling with simple red text format (`text-caption text-error`), removed background, border, and padding, added `noValidate` to form for consistent validation handling, and ensured input field text remains black (`text-airvik-black dark:text-airvik-white`) while only borders and error messages are red.

### 16. Error State Focus Border Consistency
**Issue**: Fields with validation errors were switching from red border to blue border when focused, creating inconsistent visual feedback. Additionally, there was a delay in border color changes due to CSS transitions, and hover border colors were conflicting with focus border colors.
**Fix**: Enhanced focus styling logic with `focus:ring-0`, explicit `focus:border-error`, `focus:transition-none`, and `focus:border-airvik-blue` to ensure error fields maintain red borders and red focus rings (`focus:ring-error`) when focused, while normal fields use blue borders and blue focus rings (`focus:border-airvik-blue focus:ring-airvik-blue`), eliminating any blue outline appearance, ensuring immediate border color changes without delay, and preventing hover border colors from interfering with focus states.
