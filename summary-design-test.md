## Overview
This document summarizes all the visual/UI issues that were identified and fixed during the design QA process for the Password Management and User Profiles features.

---

## Password Management Issues (1.1.3) - FIXED ✅

### 1. Forgot Password Page - Email Input Field Shake Effect
**Issue:** Email input field had unwanted shake effect due to `transition-all` instead of `transition-colors`
**Fix:** Updated input field styling to match LoginForm implementation with `transition-colors duration-normal` and proper error state styling

### 2. Forgot Password Page - Browser Default Error Handling
**Issue:** Browser's default HTML5 validation was showing instead of custom validation messages
**Fix:** Added `noValidate` attribute to the form element to disable browser validation

### 3. Forgot Password Page - Unwanted Focus Ring on Back to Login Button
**Issue:** Secondary navigation button had focus ring that created visual distraction
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` classes from the button

### 4. Forgot Password Page - Browser Default Validation Popup
**Issue:** Browser showed default validation popup for invalid email formats
**Fix:** Combined with issue #2 - the `noValidate` attribute prevents browser validation popups

### 5. Forgot Password Page - Unwanted Focus Ring on Send Reset Link Button
**Issue:** Primary action button had focus ring that created visual distraction during form submission
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` classes from the submit button

### 6. Reset Password Page - PasswordInput Component Multiple Issues
**Issue:** Multiple visual issues including shake effect, icon display problems, and unwanted focus rings
**Fix:** 
- Changed `transition-all` to `transition-colors` to eliminate shake effect
- Fixed border styling to use `border border-error` instead of just `border-error`
- Removed focus ring from toggle button and updated hover colors

### 7. Reset Password Page - Duplicate Password Strength Indicators and Unwanted Elements
**Issue:** Duplicate strength indicators and unwanted password tips box
**Fix:** 
- Removed duplicate strength indicator from PasswordInput component
- Removed password tips box from PasswordStrengthIndicator component
- Removed focus ring from Reset Password button

### 8. Reset Password Page - Unwanted Focus Rings on Expired Link Buttons
**Issue:** Both "Request New Reset Link" and "Back to Login" buttons had focus rings
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` and `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-500 focus:ring-offset-2` classes from both buttons

### 9. Reset Password Page - Input Field Border Color Not Turning Red on Validation Errors
**Issue:** Input field borders didn't turn red on validation errors due to CSS specificity issues
**Fix:** Updated conditional styling to use `border border-error` instead of just `border-error` to ensure proper CSS specificity

### 10. Forgot Password Page - Misleading Success Message for Non-Registered Emails
**Issue:** Security feature was showing success message even when no email was sent
**Status:** This is a backend security feature to prevent email enumeration. The current behavior is intentional for security reasons.

---

## User Profiles Issues (1.1.4) - FIXED ✅

### 11. Profile Page - Loading State Incorrectly Centered
**Issue:** Loading state was centered vertically on the page instead of appearing at the top
**Fix:** Restructured loading state to show header first, then loading indicator below it, maintaining proper page layout

### 12. Profile Edit Page - Duplicate Validation Error Messages
**Issue:** Both Validation Summary and FieldValidation components were showing the same errors
**Fix:** Removed the Validation Summary section entirely, keeping only the individual field validation messages

### 13. Profile Edit Page - Incorrect Error Styling for Input Fields and Error Messages
**Issue:** Input fields had red text and background colors, and error messages had complex styling
**Fix:** 
- Removed `text-error` and `bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20` classes from input fields
- Replaced complex FieldValidation component with simple error text using `text-caption text-error`
- Applied consistent error styling across all form fields

### 14. Profile Edit Page - Continuous Validation Loading Indicator on Full Name Field
**Issue:** Validation loading indicator continued to show on Full Name field when user was typing in other fields
**Status:** This issue requires changes to the validation logic in `useProfileValidation` hook and `profileValidation.ts`. The root cause is the partial data object approach in field validation.

### 15. Profile Edit Page - Mobile Number Not Displaying in ProfileCard After Save
**Issue:** Mobile number was saved but not displayed due to privacy settings condition
**Fix:** Removed the `profile.privacy.showPhone` condition from ProfileCard, now mobile number displays when it exists regardless of privacy settings

### 16. Profile Edit Page - Profile Not Updating After Save Changes
**Issue:** Profile data wasn't refreshing after successful save operation
**Fix:** 
- Modified `handleSuccess` function to redirect with `?refresh=true` parameter
- Updated ProfilePage to detect refresh parameter and force data reload
- Added URL cleanup after refresh

### 17. Profile Connections Page - Google OAuth Connection Not Working
**Issue:** "Connect Google Account" button used mock implementation instead of real OAuth
**Fix:** 
- Replaced mock implementation with real GoogleOAuthButton component
- Integrated proper OAuth flow with success/error handling
- Removed unused state variables and functions
- Added proper account linking functionality
