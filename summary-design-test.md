# Design Testing Summary - User Registration & Login

## Overview
This document summarizes all the visual testing issues that were identified and fixed for the User Registration and User Login & Session Management features.

## Registration Page Issues Fixed

### 1. Form Layout Issues
**Issue**: "Already have an account? Sign in here" and "By signing up, you agree..." text were placed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved both text elements inside the RegistrationForm component, placing them below the "Create Account" button in the correct order.

### 2. Error Message Display Consistency
**Issue**: Browser-native validation messages were inconsistent with the form's error styling.
**Fix**: Added `noValidate` attribute to the form to disable browser validation and ensure all errors use the consistent red text format.

### 3. Password Tips Message Display Issue
**Issue**: Unwanted blue informational message box appeared below password requirements.
**Fix**: Removed the password tips message box entirely from the PasswordStrengthIndicator component.

### 4. Password Requirements Visibility Behavior Issue
**Issue**: Password requirements were visible by default even when user hadn't started typing, and remained visible even after all requirements were met.
**Fix**: Implemented conditional rendering logic to show requirements only when password field is focused or contains text, and automatically hide them when all password requirements are satisfied.

### 5. Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy Links 404 Error
**Issue**: Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy resulted in 404 errors.
**Fix**: Created new pages at `/terms` and `/privacy` routes with proper content and styling.

### 6. Create Account Button Text Alignment During Loading
**Issue**: Button text shifted left during loading state instead of remaining centered.
**Fix**: Updated CSS to use `justify-center` and removed negative margin from spinner for proper centering.

### 7. Password Visibility Toggle Icon Display Issue
**Issue**: Eye icon appeared cropped or cut off when toggling password visibility.
**Fix**: Updated button styling to use fixed width and proper centering to prevent icon cropping.

### 8. Terms Consent Checkbox Extra Border Issue
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when selected, creating double-border effect.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings.

### 9. Toast Notifications for Registration Messages
**Issue**: Inconsistent use of inline error messages and success states.
**Fix**: Implemented consistent toast notifications for all success and error messages, removing inline general error display.

### 10. Post-Registration Sensitive Data Logging Issue
**Issue**: User email and tokens were being logged to console after successful registration.
**Fix**: Removed console.log statement that exposed sensitive user information.

## Login Page Issues Fixed

### 11. Duplicate "Don't have an account? Sign up for free" Text
**Issue**: Text appeared both inside the form and in the page footer, creating duplication.
**Fix**: Removed the duplicate text from the footer, keeping only the version inside the LoginForm component.

### 12. "By signing in, you agree..." Text Positioned Incorrectly
**Issue**: Terms agreement text was displayed outside the form in the footer.
**Fix**: Moved the text inside the LoginForm component, placing it below the sign-up link.

### 13. Extra Border Around "Remember me" Checkbox
**Issue**: Extra border appeared around checkbox when checked or unchecked, creating visual inconsistency.
**Fix**: Enhanced checkbox styling with `focus:outline-none`, `focus:ring-0`, `appearance-none`, and explicit focus border states to completely eliminate any extra borders or focus rings, matching the registration form checkbox styling.

### 14. Broken Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Links
**Issue**: Links resulted in 404 errors (same as registration page).
**Fix**: Links now work correctly since the pages were created for the registration page fixes.

### 15. Login Form Validation Error Message Styling Inconsistency
**Issue**: General error messages used speech bubble styling with background, border, and padding, inconsistent with field errors. Input field text was also turning red during errors.
**Fix**: Replaced speech bubble styling with simple red text format (`text-caption text-error`), removed background, border, and padding, added `noValidate` to form for consistent validation handling, and ensured input field text remains black (`text-airvik-black dark:text-airvik-white`) while only borders and error messages are red.

### 16. Error State Focus Border Consistency
**Issue**: Fields with validation errors were switching from red border to blue border when focused, creating inconsistent visual feedback. Additionally, there was a delay in border color changes due to CSS transitions, and hover border colors were conflicting with focus border colors.
**Fix**: Enhanced focus styling logic with `focus:ring-0`, explicit `focus:border-error`, `focus:transition-none`, and `focus:border-airvik-blue` to ensure error fields maintain red borders and red focus rings (`focus:ring-error`) when focused, while normal fields use blue borders and blue focus rings (`focus:border-airvik-blue focus:ring-airvik-blue`), eliminating any blue outline appearance, ensuring immediate border color changes without delay, and preventing hover border colors from interfering with focus states.

## Password Management Issues (1.1.3) - FIXED âœ…

### 1. Forgot Password Page - Email Input Field Shake Effect
**Issue:** Email input field had unwanted shake effect due to `transition-all` instead of `transition-colors`
**Fix:** Updated input field styling to match LoginForm implementation with `transition-colors duration-normal` and proper error state styling

### 2. Forgot Password Page - Browser Default Error Handling
**Issue:** Browser's default HTML5 validation was showing instead of custom validation messages
**Fix:** Added `noValidate` attribute to the form element to disable browser validation

### 3. Forgot Password Page - Unwanted Focus Ring on Back to Login Button
**Issue:** Secondary navigation button had focus ring that created visual distraction
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` classes from the button

### 4. Forgot Password Page - Browser Default Validation Popup
**Issue:** Browser showed default validation popup for invalid email formats
**Fix:** Combined with issue #2 - the `noValidate` attribute prevents browser validation popups

### 5. Forgot Password Page - Unwanted Focus Ring on Send Reset Link Button
**Issue:** Primary action button had focus ring that created visual distraction during form submission
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` classes from the submit button

### 6. Reset Password Page - PasswordInput Component Multiple Issues
**Issue:** Multiple visual issues including shake effect, icon display problems, and unwanted focus rings
**Fix:** 
- Changed `transition-all` to `transition-colors` to eliminate shake effect
- Fixed border styling to use `border border-error` instead of just `border-error`
- Removed focus ring from toggle button and updated hover colors

### 7. Reset Password Page - Duplicate Password Strength Indicators and Unwanted Elements
**Issue:** Duplicate strength indicators and unwanted password tips box
**Fix:** 
- Removed duplicate strength indicator from PasswordInput component
- Removed password tips box from PasswordStrengthIndicator component
- Removed focus ring from Reset Password button

### 8. Reset Password Page - Unwanted Focus Rings on Expired Link Buttons
**Issue:** Both "Request New Reset Link" and "Back to Login" buttons had focus rings
**Fix:** Removed `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-airvik-blue focus:ring-offset-2` and `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-500 focus:ring-offset-2` classes from both buttons

### 9. Reset Password Page - Input Field Border Color Not Turning Red on Validation Errors
**Issue:** Input field borders didn't turn red on validation errors due to CSS specificity issues
**Fix:** Updated conditional styling to use `border border-error` instead of just `border-error` to ensure proper CSS specificity

### 10. Forgot Password Page - Misleading Success Message for Non-Registered Emails
**Issue:** Security feature was showing success message even when no email was sent
**Status:** This is a backend security feature to prevent email enumeration. The current behavior is intentional for security reasons.

## User Profiles Issues (1.1.4) - FIXED âœ…

### 11. Profile Page - Loading State Incorrectly Centered
**Issue:** Loading state was centered vertically on the page instead of appearing at the top
**Fix:** Restructured loading state to show header first, then loading indicator below it, maintaining proper page layout

### 12. Profile Edit Page - Duplicate Validation Error Messages
**Issue:** Both Validation Summary and FieldValidation components were showing the same errors
**Fix:** Removed the Validation Summary section entirely, keeping only the individual field validation messages

### 13. Profile Edit Page - Incorrect Error Styling for Input Fields and Error Messages
**Issue:** Input fields had red text and background colors, and error messages had complex styling
**Fix:** 
- Removed `text-error` and `bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20` classes from input fields
- Replaced complex FieldValidation component with simple error text using `text-caption text-error`
- Applied consistent error styling across all form fields

### 14. Profile Edit Page - Continuous Validation Loading Indicator on Full Name Field
**Issue:** Validation loading indicator continued to show on Full Name field when user was typing in other fields
**Status:** This issue requires changes to the validation logic in `useProfileValidation` hook and `profileValidation.ts`. The root cause is the partial data object approach in field validation.

### 15. Profile Edit Page - Mobile Number Not Displaying in ProfileCard After Save
**Issue:** Mobile number was saved but not displayed due to privacy settings condition
**Fix:** Removed the `profile.privacy.showPhone` condition from ProfileCard, now mobile number displays when it exists regardless of privacy settings

### 16. Profile Edit Page - Profile Not Updating After Save Changes
**Issue:** Profile data wasn't refreshing after successful save operation
**Fix:** 
- Modified `handleSuccess` function to redirect with `?refresh=true` parameter
- Updated ProfilePage to detect refresh parameter and force data reload
- Added URL cleanup after refresh

### 17. Profile Connections Page - Google OAuth Connection Not Working
**Issue:** "Connect Google Account" button used mock implementation instead of real OAuth
**Fix:** 
- Replaced mock implementation with real GoogleOAuthButton component
- Integrated proper OAuth flow with success/error handling
- Removed unused state variables and functions
- Added proper account linking functionality
