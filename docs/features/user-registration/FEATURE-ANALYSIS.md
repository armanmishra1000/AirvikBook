# User Registration Analysis

## Feature Overview
User Registration provides comprehensive account creation capabilities including traditional email/password registration, Google OAuth social login, email verification, and automatic profile picture integration from Google accounts.

## Complexity Level
**Classification**: Medium
**Reasoning**: This feature involves business rules (password validation, email verification), external API integration (Google OAuth), email automation system, and social account linking which requires careful state management and multiple user flows.

## Dependencies Analysis
### Required Features
- [x] Basic Project Setup (Authentication patterns, API response format)
- [x] Email System (Brevo SMTP configuration exists)
- [x] Database Schema (User model exists in Prisma)
- [ ] JWT Authentication middleware (to be created)

### Existing Code Integration
- **Authentication patterns**: JWT tokens with sessionStorage (access) and localStorage (refresh) established
- **API patterns**: Standardized response format `{ success: boolean, data/error: any }` with `/api/v1` prefix
- **Database patterns**: Prisma PostgreSQL with User model containing all required fields (email, password, fullName, mobileNumber, googleId, isEmailVerified, profilePicture)
- **Frontend patterns**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, React Hook Form, Zod validation ready
- **Email patterns**: Brevo SMTP service configured for welcome emails and verification

## User Flows Identification
### Primary Flow
1. User accesses registration form
2. Enters email, password, full name, mobile number
3. Accepts terms and conditions
4. System validates input and creates account
5. Email verification sent (unless Google verified)
6. User verifies email and account becomes active
7. Welcome email sent
8. Redirect to dashboard/profile

### Alternative Flows
- **Google OAuth Flow**: OAuth popup → account creation → auto email verification → welcome email
- **Social Account Linking**: Link Google account to existing email account
- **Email Verification Error**: Resend verification, invalid token handling
- **Duplicate Email Error**: Show login option instead
- **Password Strength Validation**: Real-time feedback and requirements
- **Skip Email Verification**: For verified Google accounts

## Brand Compliance Requirements
- **Colors needed**: airvik-blue for primary buttons, airvik-purple for hover states, airvik-white for backgrounds, error colors for validation
- **Typography**: text-h1 for page title, text-h4 for form sections, text-body for labels and content
- **Components**: btn-primary, card, input with focus states, toast notifications
- **Interactions**: Hover, focus, active, disabled states for all interactive elements
- **Dark mode considerations**: All forms and components must support dark mode variants
