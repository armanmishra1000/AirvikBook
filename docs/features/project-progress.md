**Critical Bugs Fixed:**

## Shared Infrastructure
### Backend
- Database connection: 
- Error handling: 
- Response utilities: 
- Rate limiting middleware: Used in auth routes (can be extracted for reuse)
- JWT utilities: Implemented in auth service (can be extracted for reuse)
- Email service: Nodemailer setup in auth service (can be extracted for reuse)

### Frontend
- TypeScript types pattern: Established in`
- API service pattern: Established in 
- Form validation pattern: React Hook Form + Joi validation
- Error handling pattern: Consistent error display across components
- Loading states pattern: Consistent loading UI across forms

## Development Learnings

### From User Registration & Email Verification Feature:

**Technical Patterns Established:**
- **Backend Service Layer:** Clean separation between controllers, services, and models
- **Validation Strategy:** Joi validation in controllers + TypeScript types for compile-time safety
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format using response utilities
- **Security Practices:** bcrypt for passwords, JWT for tokens, rate limiting for endpoints
- **Email Integration:** Nodemailer setup with environment-based configuration

**Frontend Patterns Established:**
- **Next.js 14 App Router:** Proper page structure and metadata handling
- **Form Management:** React Hook Form for complex forms with validation
- **API Integration:** Fetch-based service layer with proper TypeScript typing
- **UI/UX Patterns:** Loading states, error handling, success feedback
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS

**Reusable Components for Future Features:**
- Rate limiting middleware (extract to shared middleware)
- JWT token utilities (extract to shared auth utilities)
- Email service (extract to shared communication service)
- Form validation patterns (create reusable form components)
- API error handling (standardize across all services)

**Recommendations for Next Features:**
1. Extract JWT utilities to shared auth service
2. Create reusable form components based on established patterns
3. Standardize API error handling across all frontend services
4. Consider extracting email service for broader use
5. Implement consistent loading and error UI components

### From User Login & Logout Feature:

**Technical Patterns Established:**
- **JWT Token Management:** Secure access/refresh token system with automatic renewal
- **Session Handling:** Proper token storage, cleanup, and expiration management
- **Rate Limiting:** Enhanced security with login attempt limits and account lockout
- **Middleware Architecture:** Reusable authentication middleware for protected routes
- **Error Recovery:** Comprehensive debugging protocol with problem tracking

**Frontend Integration Patterns:**
- **Token Storage:** localStorage management with automatic cleanup
- **API Integration:** Seamless frontend-backend authentication flow
- **Form Security:** Prevention of sensitive data exposure in URLs
- **Loading States:** Enhanced user experience during authentication
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages and validation feedback

**Critical Bug Prevention Learnings:**
- **Password Hashing:** Avoid double hashing by centralizing in model pre-save hooks
- **Form Submission:** Always specify method="post" to prevent GET query parameter leaks
- **Next.js 14:** Use "use client" directive for client-side components
- **Route Configuration:** Proper redirect handling for SPA routing

**Debugging Protocol Established:**
- **Problem Documentation:** Systematic tracking in PROBLEMS-LOG.md
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Deep investigation before implementing fixes
- **Prevention Steps:** Document how to avoid similar issues in future
- **Git Workflow:** Proper staging, committing, and pushing of fixes

**Reusable Components for Future Features:**
- Authentication middleware (backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts)
- JWT token utilities (can be extracted from auth service)
- Form validation patterns with react-hook-form
- Loading state management patterns
- Error display and handling components
