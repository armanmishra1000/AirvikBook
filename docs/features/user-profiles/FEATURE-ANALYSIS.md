# User Profiles Analysis

## Feature Overview
User Profiles allows authenticated users to manage their personal information, profile pictures, social account connections, and privacy settings. The feature integrates with existing Google OAuth to auto-populate profile data and provides comprehensive profile management including contact details, preferences, and connected account management.

## Complexity Level
**Classification**: Medium
**Reasoning**: This feature involves multiple data sources (Google OAuth, profile uploads), complex UI components (image upload, social account management), business logic for privacy controls, and integration with existing authentication systems. It requires file storage, image processing, and sophisticated frontend state management but does not involve external payment systems or real-time features.

## Dependencies Analysis
### Required Features
- [x] Authentication System (completed - user login/registration/password management)
- [ ] Payment System (not applicable - no payment functionality)
- [ ] Communication System (not applicable for basic profile management)

### Existing Code Integration
- **Authentication patterns**: Leverages existing JWT service with sessionStorage/localStorage token management, auth middleware patterns, and Google OAuth service for profile data
- **API patterns**: Follows established ResponseUtil.success/error format, /api/v1 prefix, Bearer token authentication headers
- **Database patterns**: Extends existing User model with additional profile fields, maintains Prisma schema patterns with proper relationships and indexing
- **Frontend patterns**: Uses existing ApiClient pattern with auto token refresh, local types only (no shared/contracts imports), type guards for response handling, brand-compliant React components

## User Flows Identification
### Primary Flow
1. User navigates to profile management page (/profile)
2. System displays current profile information (auto-populated from Google if available)
3. User edits profile fields (name, contact info, preferences)
4. User uploads new profile picture or syncs from Google
5. System validates and saves changes with success feedback

### Alternative Flows
- **Social Account Management**: Connect/disconnect Google account, manage privacy settings
- **Profile Picture Management**: Upload custom image, sync from Google, remove picture
- **Privacy Controls**: Manage visibility of profile information, social login preferences
- **Error handling scenarios**: Upload failures, validation errors, network issues
- **Edge cases**: Google account disconnection, profile picture sync conflicts, large file uploads
- **Auxiliary pages needed**: Profile edit confirmation, account connection success, error pages

## Brand Compliance Requirements
- **Colors needed**: airvik-blue for primary actions (save changes), airvik-purple for secondary actions (cancel/edit), airvik-cyan for highlights (connected accounts), success/warning/error colors for status indicators
- **Typography**: text-h3 for page title, text-h5 for section headers, text-body for form labels and content, text-label for input labels
- **Components**: Card components for profile sections, button patterns (primary/secondary/ghost), input components with validation states, image upload component, toggle switches for privacy settings
- **Interactions**: Hover states for edit buttons, focus states for all form inputs, loading states during save/upload, success animations for confirmations, smooth transitions between edit/view modes
- **Dark mode considerations**: All profile components must support dark theme variants, image upload areas need dark mode styling, connected account indicators need proper contrast

## Additional Technical Considerations
### File Storage Requirements
- Profile picture upload with image validation (size, format, dimensions)
- Image processing for profile picture optimization
- CDN integration for efficient image serving

### Privacy & Security
- Privacy settings for profile visibility
- Social account connection audit trail
- Secure handling of profile picture uploads
- Data retention policies for removed profile pictures

### Performance Considerations
- Image optimization and caching
- Lazy loading for profile pictures
- Efficient API calls for profile updates
- Client-side validation to reduce server load

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Mobile-first profile management interface
- Touch-friendly image upload interface
- Responsive profile picture display
- Mobile-optimized form layouts
