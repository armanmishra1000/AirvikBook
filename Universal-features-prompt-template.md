This system is designed for developers who rely 100% on AI. 
The developer will only copy-paste prompts and report results.

## üéØ CRITICAL RULES
Analyze the contracts and properties and everything and based on that design the features tasks and in each tasks-prompt give instructions to the AI to read the related contract before writing code, give proper path in task-prompt.md file.

Read and analyse project progress file to check the all implimented features and existing files, and functions.
docs/features/project-progress.md 

now you have to impliment the feature new feature with existing features, so you have to check the existing files and functions and impliment the new feature.

### Step 0.5: Integration Analysis
Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/INTEGRATION-POINTS.md`:
```markdown
# Integration Points for [Feature Name]

## Dependencies on Existing Features:
- [ ] Uses authentication from user-login feature
- [ ] Token storage pattern: sessionStorage for access, localStorage for refresh
- [ ] API pattern: /api/v1/[resource]/[action]
- [ ] Response format: { success: true/false, data/error }

## Shared Code to Reuse:
- Authentication middleware: backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts
- Response utilities: backend/src/utils/response.utils.ts
- Auth service patterns: frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts

## Potential Conflicts:
- None identified / List any conflicts
```

### Step 1: Create AI Memory System

A. Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/CURRENT-STATE.md`
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Current State

## Last Updated: [timestamp]

## Integration Dependencies:
<!-- List features this depends on -->
- Authentication: user-login feature
- User Model: from user-registration

## What Exists Now:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->

## Testing Summary:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->
- Tests Created: [count]/[total]
- Tests Passing: [count]/[total]  
- Backend Tests: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Frontend Tests: ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Integration Tests: ‚úÖ/‚ùå

## Problems Resolved:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->
- Total Issues: [count]
- Recent Problems: [brief list]

## API Contracts:
<!-- Copy from API-CONTRACT.md once created -->

## Next Task: 
<!-- Current task from TASK-LIST.md -->

## Git Status:
<!-- Last commit hash and message -->

## Known Issues:
<!-- Any problems discovered -->
```

B. Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/API-CONTRACT.md`
```markdown
# [Feature Name] API Contract

## RULE: Frontend and Backend MUST follow this EXACTLY

### Base Configuration
- Base URL: http://localhost:5000
- API Prefix: /api/v1
- Auth Token Location: sessionStorage.getItem('airvik_access_token')
- Refresh Token Location: localStorage.getItem('airvik_refresh_token')

### [Endpoint Name]
**Backend MUST provide:**
- Method: POST
- URL: /api/v1/[resource]/[action]
- Headers: Authorization: Bearer [token]
- Request Body:
```json
{
  "field1": "string",
  "field2": "number"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "field1": "value1",
    "field2": 123
  }
}
```

**Error Response (400):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR"
}
```

**Frontend MUST expect:**
- Exact same response structure
- No variations allowed
```

C. Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/TASK-LIST.md`
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Task List

## Pre-Implementation Checks:
- [ ] Read project-progress.md
- [ ] Check integration points
- [ ] Verify token storage patterns
- [ ] Confirm API patterns

## Backend Tasks (Do First):
- [ ] B1: Create/Extend MongoDB Schema
- [ ] B2: Create Service Layer  
- [ ] B3: Create Controller
- [ ] B4: Create Routes
- [ ] B5: Create Postman Tests

## Frontend Tasks (Do After Backend):
- [ ] F1: Create Types
- [ ] F2: Create API Service
- [ ] F3: Create UI Component
- [ ] F4: Create Page/Route
- [ ] F5: Connect to Backend

## Final Tasks:
- [ ] T1: Integration Testing
- [ ] T2: Update project-progress.md

## Current Task: Pre-Implementation Checks
```


D. Create docs/features/[feature-name]/PROBLEMS-LOG.md
```markdown
# [Feature Name] Problems Log

## Purpose: AI learns from errors to prevent repeating them

## Entry Format:
### Problem #[number] - [Date] - [Task]
**Problem:** [Detailed description]
**Error Message:** [Exact error text]
**Root Cause:** [Why it happened]
**Test Failed:** [Which test failed]

**Solution Applied:**
[Step-by-step fix]

**Test Result:** ‚úÖ PASSED
**Prevention:** [How to avoid in future]
**Code Changes:** [Files modified]

---
```



### Step 2: Analyze Existing Project Structure
Look in /vikbooking folder and find files related to [FEATURE_NAME]:

List exact file paths
Note business logic patterns
Extract validation rules
Document user flows

**Additional Checks:**
- Token storage patterns in auth.service.ts
- API endpoint patterns in existing routes
- Response format patterns in controllers
- Middleware usage patterns

### Step 2.5: Setup Testing Requirements
**Testing Tools Required:**

**Backend Testing:**
- Jest for unit tests
- Supertest for API tests  
- Newman for Postman tests

**Frontend Testing:**
- Jest + React Testing Library
- TypeScript compiler for type tests
- Cypress for integration tests

**Test Commands:**
- Backend: `npm run test:backend`
- Frontend: `npm run test:frontend`
- Integration: `npm run test:integration`
- Newman: `newman run postman/[feature].postman_collection.json`

Step 3: Create Feature Documentation
A. Create docs/features/[feature-name]/spec.md
Include:

Feature Overview: Exactly what this ONE feature does (2-3 sentences)
VikBooking Analysis: Reference files and logic found
User Flow: Step-by-step how user uses this feature
API Endpoints: List each endpoint needed
Database Schema: MongoDB structure for THIS feature only
Validation Rules: All input validations needed
File Structure: Where each file will be created (max 400 lines each)

B. Create detailed docs/features/[feature-name]/api.md
This is CRITICAL - prevents API mismatches!
For EACH endpoint:
markdown## [Endpoint Name] - [HTTP Method] [URL]

### Contract Agreement:
Backend provides ‚Üí Frontend expects ‚Üí MUST MATCH EXACTLY

### Backend Implementation:
- Controller: `backend/src/controllers/[feature]/[action].controller.ts`
- Service: `backend/src/services/[feature]/[action].service.ts`
- Validation: `backend/src/validators/[feature]/[action].validator.ts`

### Frontend Usage:
- Service call: `frontend/src/services/[feature].service.ts`
- Component: `frontend/src/components/[feature]/[Component].tsx`

### Request:
```json
{
  "exact": "structure",
  "with": "examples"
}
Response Success (200):
json{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "exact": "structure",
    "that": "frontend expects"
  }
}
Response Error (400):
json{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Human readable message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE"
}

### C. Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/tasks.md`
Structure for SINGLE developer doing everything:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Tasks

[Continue with error handling prompt...]
Step 5: Initialize Tracking
Create docs/features/[feature-name]/progress.md:
markdown# [Feature Name] Progress

## Feature: [feature-name]
## Developer: [name]  
## Status: Not Started
## Branch: feature/[feature-name]

## Task Checklist:
### Backend:
- [ ] B1: MongoDB Schema
- [ ] B2: Service Layer
- [ ] B3: Controller  
- [ ] B4: Routes
- [ ] B5: Postman Tests

### Frontend:
- [ ] F1: TypeScript Types
- [ ] F2: API Service
- [ ] F3: UI Component
- [ ] F4: Page/Route
- [ ] F5: Backend Integration

## Completed Tasks:
<!-- AI updates this after each task -->

## Current State:
See CURRENT-STATE.md for details
Step 6: Generate Summary
Display:
‚úÖ Feature "[feature-name]" created with AI MEMORY SYSTEM!

üìÅ AI Memory Files Created:
- CURRENT-STATE.md - AI tracks what exists (CRITICAL!)
- API-CONTRACT.md - Prevents API mismatches  
- TASK-LIST.md - Order of tasks
- PROBLEMS-LOG.md - AI learns from errors

üìÅ Documentation Created:
- spec.md - Feature specification
- api.md - Detailed API contracts
- tasks.md - All tasks for single developer
- task-prompts.md - Copy-paste prompts for EVERY task
- progress.md - Progress tracking

üöÄ Developer Instructions:
1. You are assigned to complete this ENTIRE feature
2. Start with Task B1 - copy prompt from task-prompts.md
3. Complete ALL backend tasks first (B1-B5)
4. Test backend thoroughly with Postman
5. Then do ALL frontend tasks (F1-F5)
6. AI will track everything in CURRENT-STATE.md

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES:
- One developer does entire feature (no handoffs)
- Backend MUST be complete before starting frontend
- Every task prompt tells AI to read CURRENT-STATE.md first
- Maximum 400 lines per file (optimal for AI)
- Follow API-CONTRACT.md exactly (no variations)
- Every task includes git add, commit, push

üîÑ If you get errors:
1. Copy exact error message
2. Use error fix prompt from task-prompts.md
3. AI will read PROBLEMS-LOG.md and fix itself

üìä Git Workflow:
- Every task creates a separate commit
- Commit messages describe what was done
- Push after every task to keep team updated
- Other developers can see progress in real-time

### Step 7: Create Integration Test Plan
Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/INTEGRATION-TESTS.md`:
```markdown
# Integration Test Plan

## Token Storage Tests:
- [ ] Access token retrieved from sessionStorage
- [ ] Refresh token retrieved from localStorage
- [ ] Tokens included in API headers

## API Integration Tests:
- [ ] Endpoints use /api/v1 prefix
- [ ] Response format matches contract
- [ ] Error handling consistent

## Feature Integration Tests:
- [ ] Works with existing auth system
- [ ] Permissions checked properly
- [ ] Data relationships maintained
```

### Step 8: Project Progress Update Instructions
Create `docs/features/[feature-name]/PROJECT-UPDATE.md`:
```markdown
# Project Progress Update Instructions

After feature is complete, add to docs/features/project-progress.md:

### [Feature Name]
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  
**Developer:** [Name]  
**Branch:** feature/[feature-name]  
**Completed:** [Date]

**Description:** [Brief description of what the feature does]

**Files Created:**

*Backend:*
- List all backend files created

*Frontend:*
- List all frontend files created

*Shared:*
- List any shared/contract files

**Key Features Implemented:**
- List main functionality added

**Integration Points:**
- How it integrates with existing features

**Shared Code Created:**
- Reusable components/utilities created

**Lessons Learned:**
- Any important discoveries or patterns
```

## Task Prompt Updates

### Add to EVERY Task Prompt:

**MANDATORY INTEGRATION CHECKS:**
1. Read docs/features/[feature-name]/INTEGRATION-POINTS.md
2. Verify token storage: sessionStorage for access, localStorage for refresh
3. Verify API pattern: /api/v1/[resource]/[action]
4. Check response format matches existing patterns

### Add to Final Task (After F5):

## Final Task T1: Integration Testing
```
YOUR TASK:
Run integration tests to ensure feature works with existing system

TESTS TO RUN:
1. Login with existing user
2. Navigate to new feature
3. Verify tokens are found correctly
4. Verify API calls succeed
5. Test error scenarios

FIXES IF NEEDED:
- Token issues: Check sessionStorage/localStorage keys
- API 404: Ensure /api/v1 prefix is used
- Auth errors: Verify middleware is applied
```

## Final Task T2: Update Project Documentation
```
YOUR TASK:
Update the main project progress file

FILE TO UPDATE:
docs/features/project-progress.md

WHAT TO ADD:
Copy content from PROJECT-UPDATE.md and add to the file

GIT OPERATIONS:
