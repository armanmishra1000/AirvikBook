## 🔄 CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Feature Branch Analysis**
1. Review each feature branch for conflicts
2. Identify overlapping functionality
3. Plan merge order to minimize conflicts
4. Document any dependencies between features

### **Phase 2: Sequential Merging**
1. **User Registration** (Base feature)
2. **User Login & Session Management** (Depends on registration)
3. **Password Management** (Depends on login)
4. **User Profiles** (Depends on user authentication)

### **Phase 3: Integration Testing**
1. Test all features work together
2. Verify no conflicts between features
3. Ensure security measures are intact
4. Validate data flow between components

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup**
1. Update feature documentation
2. Remove redundant code
3. Standardize coding patterns
4. Create integration guide

## 🎯 MERGE ORDER

```bash
# 1. Start with User Registration (base)
git merge feature/user-registration

# 2. Add User Login & Session Management
git merge feature/user-login

# 3. Add Password Management
git merge feature/password-management

# 4. Add User Profiles
git merge yash/feature/user-profiles
```

## 🚨 CONFLICT RESOLUTION PLAN

### **Potential Conflict Areas:**
1. **Authentication Routes** - Multiple login/registration endpoints
2. **User Model** - Different user schema definitions
3. **Middleware** - Authentication and validation middleware
4. **Frontend Components** - Registration and login forms
5. **API Endpoints** - User management endpoints

### **Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Route Consolidation** - Merge similar endpoints
2. **Model Unification** - Create comprehensive user model
3. **Middleware Integration** - Combine security measures
4. **Component Refactoring** - Create unified auth components
5. **API Standardization** - Follow RESTful conventions
