## FAILING TESTS

### 1. PasswordManagementService › changePassword › should successfully change password for email account

**File:** `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:207`  
**Error:** `expect(received).toBe(expected)` - Expected: true, Received: false  
**Stack Trace:** 
```
at Object.<anonymous> (src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:207:30)
```

**Suspected Source:** PasswordManagementService.changePassword method  
**Type:** Regression - Password change functionality not working  
**Root Cause Analysis:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Cause:** The test password `'NewPassword123!'` contains the sequential pattern `'123'` which is flagged by the `hasSequentialCharacters()` validation method. When normalized to lowercase, the password becomes `'newpassword123!'` and the `'123'` sequence is detected as a security risk.

**What part of the logic is broken:** The password validation is working correctly, but the test passwords don't meet the enhanced security requirements.

**Why did it fail:** The `hasSequentialCharacters()` method includes `'123'` in its blacklist of sequential patterns, which is overly strict for test scenarios.

**Contributing factors:** 
- Enhanced password security was added but test passwords weren't updated
- Sequential character detection is too broad (includes common number sequences)
- No test mode or exception handling for test scenarios

**Edge cases missed:** Test passwords need to be updated to meet new security requirements

**✅ FIXED** - Updated test password from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern `'123'` detection. The new password meets all security requirements without triggering sequential pattern detection.

### 2. PasswordManagementService › changePassword › should reject incorrect current password

**File:** `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:235`  
**Error:** `expect(received).toBe(expected)` - Expected: "INVALID_CURRENT_PASSWORD", Received: "PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK"  
**Stack Trace:** 
```
at Object.<anonymous> (src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:235:27)
```

**Suspected Source:** PasswordManagementService.changePassword method - password validation logic  
**Type:** Regression - Wrong error code being returned  
**Root Cause Analysis:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Cause:** Same as test #1 - the new password `'NewPassword123!'` contains the sequential pattern `'123'` which triggers the `PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK` error before the current password validation can run.

**What part of the logic is broken:** The validation order is correct, but the test password fails strength validation before reaching the current password check.

**Why did it fail:** Password strength validation runs before current password validation, and the test password doesn't meet the enhanced security requirements.

**Contributing factors:** 
- Same sequential character issue as test #1
- Validation order is actually correct (strength first, then current password)

**Edge cases missed:** Test passwords need to be updated to meet new security requirements

**✅ FIXED** - Same fix as test #1: Updated test password from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern detection.

### 3. PasswordManagementService › setPasswordForGoogleUser › should successfully set password for Google-only user

**File:** `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:304`  
**Error:** `expect(received).toBe(expected)` - Expected: true, Received: false  
**Stack Trace:** 
```
at Object.<anonymous> (src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:304:30)
```

**Suspected Source:** PasswordManagementService.setPasswordForGoogleUser method  
**Type:** Regression - Google user password setting not working  
**Root Cause Analysis:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Cause:** Same as tests #1 and #2 - the test password `'NewPassword123!'` contains the sequential pattern `'123'` which is flagged by the password strength validation.

**What part of the logic is broken:** The password validation is working correctly, but the test password doesn't meet the enhanced security requirements.

**Why did it fail:** The `setPasswordForGoogleUser` method uses the same `validatePasswordStrength()` method as `changePassword`, so it has the same sequential character validation issue.

**Contributing factors:** 
- Same sequential character issue as previous tests
- Both methods share the same password validation logic

**Edge cases missed:** Test passwords need to be updated to meet new security requirements

**✅ FIXED** - Same fix as previous tests: Updated test password from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern detection.

### 4. PasswordManagementService › setPasswordForGoogleUser › should reject setting password for account that already has one

**File:** `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:331`  
**Error:** `expect(received).toBe(expected)` - Expected: "PASSWORD_ALREADY_EXISTS", Received: "PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK"  
**Stack Trace:** 
```
at Object.<anonymous> (src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:331:27)
```

**Suspected Source:** PasswordManagementService.setPasswordForGoogleUser method - validation logic  
**Type:** Regression - Wrong error code being returned  
**Root Cause Analysis:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Cause:** Same as previous tests - the test password `'NewPassword123!'` contains the sequential pattern `'123'` which triggers the `PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK` error before the existing password check can run.

**What part of the logic is broken:** The validation order is correct, but the test password fails strength validation before reaching the existing password check.

**Why did it fail:** Password strength validation runs before checking if the account already has a password, and the test password doesn't meet the enhanced security requirements.

**Contributing factors:** 
- Same sequential character issue as previous tests
- Validation order is actually correct (strength first, then business logic checks)

**Edge cases missed:** Test passwords need to be updated to meet new security requirements

**✅ FIXED** - Same fix as previous tests: Updated test password from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern detection.

### 5. PasswordManagementService › setPasswordForGoogleUser › should reject setting password for account without Google authentication

**File:** `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:354`  
**Error:** `expect(received).toBe(expected)` - Expected: "GOOGLE_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED", Received: "PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK"  
**Stack Trace:** 
```
at Object.<anonymous> (src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts:354:27)
```

**Suspected Source:** PasswordManagementService.setPasswordForGoogleUser method - validation logic  
**Type:** Regression - Wrong error code being returned  
**Root Cause Analysis:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Cause:** Same as all previous tests - the test password `'NewPassword123!'` contains the sequential pattern `'123'` which triggers the `PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK` error before the Google authentication check can run.

**What part of the logic is broken:** The validation order is correct, but the test password fails strength validation before reaching the Google authentication check.

**Why did it fail:** Password strength validation runs before checking if the account has Google authentication, and the test password doesn't meet the enhanced security requirements.

**Contributing factors:** 
- Same sequential character issue as all previous tests
- Validation order is actually correct (strength first, then business logic checks)

**Edge cases missed:** Test passwords need to be updated to meet new security requirements

**✅ FIXED** - Same fix as all previous tests: Updated test password from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern detection.

## OBSERVATIONS

### Common Patterns:
1. **All failures return "PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK"** - This suggests a password validation issue is blocking all operations
2. **Both changePassword and setPasswordForGoogleUser affected** - Indicates a shared validation component
3. **Error codes not matching expected values** - Validation logic may be running before proper checks

### Suspected Issues:
1. Password strength validation may be too strict or incorrectly implemented
2. Validation order may be wrong (checking password strength before other validations)
3. Test passwords may not meet current strength requirements
4. Password validation service may have been modified recently

## RESOLUTION HISTORY

### Summary of Fixes Applied

**Date:** 2025-08-08  
**Root Cause:** All 5 failing tests were caused by the same issue - test passwords containing sequential patterns that triggered enhanced password security validation.

**Solution:** Updated all test passwords from `'NewPassword123!'` to `'SecurePass247!'` to avoid sequential pattern detection.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/tests/passwordManagement.test.ts` - Updated 5 test cases
- `src/tests/passwordReset.test.ts` - Updated 3 test cases

**Technical Details:**
- The `hasSequentialCharacters()` method in `PasswordManagementService` flags passwords containing sequences like `'123'`, `'456'`, `'789'`, etc.
- The test password `'NewPassword123!'` contained `'123'` which triggered the `PASSWORD_TOO_WEAK` error
- The new password `'SecurePass247!'` meets all security requirements without containing any sequential patterns
- All validation logic was working correctly; the issue was with test data not meeting enhanced security requirements

**Result:** ✅ All 167 tests now pass (0 failures)
